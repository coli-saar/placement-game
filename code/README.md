# Code

This directory contains the necessary code used for running the game via a Slurk server. The guide below will show you how to run the game with Slurk.

## Instructions for running the object placement game

### Prerequisites:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements from ```requirements.txt```
3. Spin up a Slurk server (follow instructions [here](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_gettingstarted.html)) (**IMPORTANT!** Make sure to save the room key that gets generated!)
4. Clone the  the Slurk-bots repositor ([source](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk-bots))


### Steps:

5. Place the ```/placement-game/code/placement/``` directory in the root of the ```slurk-bots``` directory
6. Run the ```start_bot.py``` (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk-bots/blob/master/README.md)) script in the following way:

- for human-human play (generates two rooms for human players): 

        python start_bot.py placement --users 2 --config-file [CONFIG] --waiting-room-id [ID] --bot-name [NAME] --copy-plugins

- for human-LLM play (generates single room for a human player):

        python start_bot.py placement --users 1 --config-file [CONFIG] --waiting-room-id [ID] --bot-name [NAME] --copy-plugins

Notes:

- ```CONFIG```: json file with Slruk credentials; example:

        host = [url]
        token = [token]
- ```config.py```: contains personal OpenAI API code;
- ```ID```: generated by spinning up a Slurk server
- ```NAME```: your bot's name

This will generate keys for using the Slurk room with the initalized game. Follow the links that get generated to enter the room, or go to your slurk host and enter the generated token.

In the development stage, use the -dev flag.
