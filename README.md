# A Dialogue Game for Eliciting Balanced Collaboration

This is the repository containing the crowdsourced data of pairs playing the 2D object placement game we developed, and the game itself, as detailed in our paper ["A Dialogue Game for Eliciting Balanced Collaboration"]((https://aclanthology.org/2024.sigdial-1.41/)) ([**Paper web page**](https://coli-saar.github.io/balancedcollab)). 

#### IMPORTANT!

**The raw jsonl files can be found in the [```/crowdsourced_data```](https://github.com/coli-saar/placement-game/tree/main/crowdsourced_data) subdirectory, while the code and deployment instructions can be found in the [```/code```](https://github.com/coli-saar/placement-game/tree/main/code) subdirectory.**  The ```/images``` subdirectory contains the front-end elements loaded into the game.

## Project description

Collaboration is an integral part of human dialogue. Typical task-oriented dialogue games assign asymmetric roles to the participants, which limits their ability to elicit naturalistic role-taking in collaboration and its negotiation. We present a novel and simple online setup that favors balanced collaboration: a two-player 2D object placement game in which the players must negotiate the goal state themselves. We show empirically that human players exhibit a variety of role distributions, and that balanced collaboration improves task performance. We also present an LLM-based baseline agent which demonstrates that automatic playing of our game is an interesting challenge for artificial systems.
